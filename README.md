# 3-DOF Robot Arm Kinematics

## Introduction
This repository meticulously explores the intricate mechanics of a 3 degrees of freedom (3-DOF) robot arm, focusing on the fundamental calculations of both inverse and forward kinematics. By understanding these calculations, we can precisely determine the robot arm's end effector position in Cartesian coordinates from its joint angles, and conversely, derive the joint angles necessary to achieve a desired end effector position.

## Problem Statement
The primary objective is to compute the precise Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) of the robot arm's end effector given its joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3), and to determine the joint angles required to reach a specific Cartesian position.

## Configuration
- **Link Lengths**:
  - \( L_1 \): Length of the first link
  - \( L_2 \): Length of the second link
  - \( L_3 \): Length of the third link
  
- **Joint Angles**:
  - \( \theta_1 \): Angle between the base and the first link
  - \( \theta_2 \): Angle between the first and second links
  - \( \theta_3 \): Angle between the second and third links

## Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics equations compute the end effector's position (x, y, z) in Cartesian coordinates based on the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3):
- \( x = L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + L_3 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3) \)
- \( y = L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + L_3 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3) \)
- \( z = L_3 \sin(\theta_3) \)

## Inverse Kinematics
Inverse kinematics involves determining the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) from a desired Cartesian position (x, y, z). Detailed steps and equations for solving the inverse kinematics problem are provided, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of how to achieve precise control over the robot arm's movements.

## Methodology
The methodology section details the approach taken to solve the kinematics problems, including any algorithms or numerical methods employed. Challenges encountered during the process are discussed, alongside strategies for overcoming them to ensure accurate results.

## Results
Sample calculations and examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the kinematic equations in practical scenarios, showcasing how the robot arm's position and orientation can be computed and controlled effectively.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this repository not only provides a robust solution to the 3-DOF robot arm kinematics problem but also offers deep insights into the mathematical foundations that underpin robotic motion planning and control. By understanding these principles, engineers and enthusiasts alike can enhance their ability to design and program robotic systems with precision and efficiency.
